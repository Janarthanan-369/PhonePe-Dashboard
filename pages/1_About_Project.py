# Data Migration
st.header("Data Migration")
st.write("""
Data extracted from raw JSON files (simulating unstructured sources like MongoDB)  
was transformed into tabular form and loaded into **PostgreSQL** for analytical processing.

- Q4 consistently shows higher transaction volumes due to seasonal spikes.  
- Insurance adoption shows steady growth but is concentrated in metro areas.
""")

# Feature Engineering
st.header("Feature Engineering")
st.write("""
- Created **transaction density** metric combining count and amount per state.  
- Generated quarter-based temporal features for trend analysis.
""")

# Statistical Techniques

st.write("""
Applied **Pearson Correlation** to measure the relationship between transaction count  
and amount, confirming a strong positive correlation.
